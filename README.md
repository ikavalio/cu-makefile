# cu-makefile

Makefile for building [Cu](https://alchitry.com/collections/all/products/alchitry-cu-fpga-development-board) projects without [Alchitry-Labs](https://github.com/alchitry/Alchitry-Labs).

Makefile works with the Alchitry-Labs default folder structure and uses a different prefix for all generated files (cu instead of alchitry), so it shouldn't overwrite any files it didn't create.

## Prerequisites

- [fpga-toolchain](https://github.com/YosysHQ/fpga-toolchain)
